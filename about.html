<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Isaac Munoz and I am 29 years old I've always wanted to learn how to code</p>

<p>I was first introduced to coding by my God brother when he showed me how to change my Myspace background!</p>

<p>Movies like "The Social Network" and "The Internship" made me fall in love with coding so I guess I have to thank Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfeild for making it look so easy! </p>
